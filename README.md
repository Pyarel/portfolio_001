# Portfolio_baseline

Hey there!!

Hope you're having a good day.

I have created a baseline using HTML and CSS to build a simple resume webpage to kickstart your career.

* Use my baseline for creating your resumes using HTML and CSS.
* Customize the document as per your choice.
* Build your resume on top of the baseline and modify it as per your requirements.

Look how cool it looks in the browser!
